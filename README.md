# cloud.gov (and Cloud Foundry) Drupal 7 example

_(For Drupal 8, see https://github.com/18F/cf-ex-drupal8/.)_

This repository includes an in-progress example of using Drupal 7 with [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org), the system that's used by the [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) platform-as-a-service offering.

This example installs PHP and Drupal 7. Then you complete the installation, with username and password, by visiting the unauthenticated `/install.php` page in the app. The example uses MySQL for the database but doesn't yet handle persistent asset storage.
