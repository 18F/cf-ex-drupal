# cloud.gov (and Cloud Foundry) Drupal examples

This repository includes two examples of using Drupal with [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org), the PaaS that's used by (cloud.gov)[https://cloud.gov]:

* [Drupal 8](./drupal-8/README.md): This example installs PHP and Drupal, then configures the site as a standard installation with the administrator username and password that you set as Cloud Foundry environment variables. It uses MySQL for the database, and AWS S3 for asset storage.
